In order to run the app, a configuration file needs to be created to set the environment for the App and the proper service information like Auth Token.

### Create a file in the root of your project called: `.envconfig`

```bash
vi .envconfig

HOST_IMAGE_URL=image.tmdb.org

```

Then just run the project and enjoy!!!

## App Architecture

The app was built using Clean Architecture and MVVM in SwiftUI, with Clean architecture we aim for the separation of concerns among components and as for MVVM, along with TCA, are ones of the most viable options to use for SwiftUI app architecture, hence MVVM was selected since it is a more traditional and widely adopted pattern, separating concerns between UI, presentation logic, and data/business logic.
